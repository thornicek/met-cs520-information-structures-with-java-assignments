# CS520 Assignment 1 Tomas Hornicek

My code for assignment 1 can be found in the "src" folder

For my first part of assignment 1, I have created a file: "Banking.java". The program is a simple Java Swing GUI ATM application, which asks the user how much money they want withdrawn. The ATM application then proceeds and with the help of the built in remainder function(%), gives the user break down of the bills, they will receive from the ATM.

For the second part of my assignment, I have created a file: "Triples.java". The function of the program is to find all the triplet numbers(a^2 + b^2 = c^2) for x =< 100. The output of the program can be found in the console.
