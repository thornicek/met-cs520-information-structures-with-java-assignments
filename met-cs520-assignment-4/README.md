# CS520 Assignment 4 Tomas Hornicek

My code for assignment 4 can be found in the "src/HW4_THornicek" folder.  For my assignment I have visited the following site: https://webrobots.io/indiegogo-dataset, downloaded 6 csv files and placed them in my root folder of the project. I have also created and uploaded to the root folder, an empty "Data.csv" file. 

My assignment contains two Java classes: "FileMerge.java" and "SearchClass.java". The FileMerge class uses BufferedReader to copy the content of the 6 csv files into the empty "Data.csv" file. Once merged, the SearchClass searches the "Data.csv" file for the keyword "robot" and prints out to the console all the rows that contain the keyword.
